# ldgpMTCNNRealTimeFaceDetection-Recognition
Final Year B.Tech. Project featuring a solution for the Real Time Face Detection and Recognition problem to be implemented on light single board computers. 

Pipeline overview:

Haar Cascade/ LDGP/ LBP face detection module cascaded with Multi Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network face recognition module, to reduce overhead
for signle board computers with memory constraints.
